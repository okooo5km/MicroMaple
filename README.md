# Micro Maple

**Micro Maple** is an opensource hardware like **Maple mini** created by Leaflab and disigned to realize our idea and creat our works more quickly and simply ! 

Basically, **STM32F103C8T6** works as the core -- it's very cheap and enough for our most ideas!

The features of **STM32F103C8T6**:

- ARM 32bits Cortex-M3 CPU
  - 72MHz, 1.25DMips/MHz(Dhrystone 2.1)
  - single cycle for Multiplication and Division
- 64K FLASH And 20K SRAM
- Two 12bits ADC, 1 us for transition
- 7 channel DMA for USART\Timer\ADC\SPI\IIC
- 16 External Interrupt
- 7 Timer
- Interface
  - 2 IIC
  - 3 USART
  - 3 SPI
  - CAN
  - USB2.0
